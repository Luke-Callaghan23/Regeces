# Regeces
This is a small Regex engine written in C.

I decided to create a small Regex engine in the C programming language as a challenge to myself, because when I first started programming in C,
I found it difficult to get a hang of.  

As a part of this challenge to myself, I also decided to create all the data structures that I would be using to make the Regex engine.
These data structures include my implementations of: String, LinkedList, ArrayList, HashTable, and, of course, Regex.

As a part of this small CLI based tool, you can experiment with my implementations of these data structures, as well as testing out my implementation
of a Regex engine in C.




****NOTE -- this CLI was written in Visual Studio 2019 on Windows and uses that compileer.  There may be compatability issues with other compilers.
